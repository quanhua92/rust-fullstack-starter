### 🔧 LESSON 15: The Rename Script - System Transformation
*"Making it my own system"*

**🎯 Your Mission:**
Execute the 314-line rename script and validate with the 497-line test suite to transform "starter" into YOUR custom system.

**📂 Files to Explore:**
1. **`scripts/rename-project.sh`** - Complete transformation script (314 lines)
2. **`scripts/test-rename-project.sh`** - Comprehensive validation (497 lines)
3. **Your backup directory** - Created automatically for safety
4. **All transformed files** - See patterns across the entire codebase

**🔍 Your Discoveries:**
- [ ] **8-Phase Process**: Docker stop → backup → rename → patterns → env vars → restart → validate
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Support**: macOS and Linux sed compatibility
- [ ] **4-Step Validation**: Environment setup → execution → pattern check → quality pipeline
- [ ] **Zero Downtime**: Proper service coordination during transformation

**🧪 Hands-On Experiments:**
1. **Full Rename**: `./scripts/rename-project.sh your_project_name --verbose`
2. **Validation Suite**: `./scripts/test-rename-project.sh your_project_name --verbose`
3. **Quality Assurance**: Run complete `./scripts/check.sh` on renamed system
4. **Pattern Analysis**: Search for remaining "starter" references

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Successfully renamed system to your custom name
- [ ] All 497 lines of validation tests pass
- [ ] Quality pipeline runs without errors
- [ ] System boots and functions with new identity

### 🎓 LESSON 16: Mastery Demonstration - Production Deployment
*"Prove you own this system completely"*

**🎯 Your Mission:**
Build a custom task handler, extend E2E tests, and deploy your renamed system to production following actual codebase patterns.

**📂 Files to Master:**
1. **`starter/src/tasks/handlers.rs`** - Study existing 6 handlers (356 lines)
2. **`starter/src/tasks/helpers.rs`** - Master helper macros (152 lines)
3. **`web/e2e/auth.spec.ts`** - Extend E2E testing patterns (98 lines)
4. **Production deployment** - Docker, health checks, monitoring

**🔍 Your Custom Challenge:**
Create an "Invoice Processing" task handler following the exact patterns from `ReportGenerationTaskHandler`:

**Phase 1: Task Handler Implementation**
- [ ] Build `InvoiceProcessingTaskHandler` using actual macro patterns
- [ ] Use `extract_fields!`, `require_field!`, `require_typed_field!` macros
- [ ] Follow exact error handling from existing handlers
- [ ] Register handler in `register_example_handlers()` function

**Phase 2: E2E Testing Extension**
- [ ] Extend `auth.spec.ts` with invoice processing flow
- [ ] Follow timestamp patterns from line 31: `Date.now()`
- [ ] Use established registration → login → redirect patterns
- [ ] Test form validation following `example.spec.ts`

**Phase 3: Production Deployment**
- [ ] Execute rename script with custom name (314 lines)
- [ ] Validate with test script (497 lines)
- [ ] Deploy using actual `Dockerfile.prod`
- [ ] Run chaos testing scenarios
- [ ] Monitor with 5 health endpoints

**🧪 Hands-On Implementation:**
```rust
// Your custom task handler following real patterns
pub struct InvoiceProcessingTaskHandler;

#[async_trait]
impl TaskHandler for InvoiceProcessingTaskHandler {
    async fn handle(&self, context: TaskContext) -> Result<TaskResult, TaskError> {
        // Use actual macros from helpers.rs
        let (invoice_id, customer_id, amount) =
            extract_fields!(context.payload, "invoice_id", "customer_id", "amount")?;
        
        // Follow exact timing patterns from existing handlers
        tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(1200)).await;
        
        // Return structured result following TaskResult patterns
        Ok(TaskResult::success(serde_json::json!({
            "invoice_id": invoice_id,
            "processed_at": chrono::Utc::now(),
            "status": "processed"
        })))
    }
}
```

**🎭 E2E Test Extension:**
```typescript
test('invoice processing flow', async ({ page }) => {
  // Follow exact timestamp pattern from auth.spec.ts line 31
  const timestamp = Date.now();
  const email = `invoicetest_${timestamp}@example.com`;
  
  // Use established patterns for registration and login
  // Test your custom invoice processing UI
});
```

**✅ Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Custom task handler follows exact patterns from existing handlers
- [ ] E2E tests extend real auth.spec.ts patterns correctly
- [ ] Rename script execution completes all 4 validation phases
- [ ] Production deployment uses actual Docker configuration
- [ ] System passes all chaos testing scenarios
- [ ] Health endpoints respond correctly in production

**🏆 Final Mastery Validation:**
- [ ] **Code Review**: Handler matches existing patterns exactly
- [ ] **System Testing**: Rename + E2E + deployment work together
- [ ] **Production Operation**: Deploy and monitor real system
- [ ] **Teaching Demonstration**: Explain your implementation to others
