## Security Enhancements 🔒

### ✅ Security Phase 1: Core Authentication Security - COMPLETED
**Status**: All critical security features implemented ✅

**Completed Features**:
- [x] **Session Fixation Prevention**: Auto-invalidates sessions older than 30 days on login
- [x] **Timing Attack Protection**: Constant-time password comparison with dummy hash processing
- [x] **Enhanced Password Validation**: Case-insensitive common password detection (75+ validation rules)
- [x] **Database Security**: Proper error propagation, removed unsafe unwrap_or(0) patterns
- [x] **Transaction Safety**: Fixed race conditions in soft-delete operations
- [x] **RFC-Compliant Email Validation**: Comprehensive validation with 75+ rules
- [x] **RBAC Security**: User access pattern optimizations and consistent error handling
- [x] **Comprehensive Security Testing**: 149 tests including 10+ security vulnerability tests

### ⏳ Security Phase 2: Additional Hardening (Future Implementation)
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium - Additional security features

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement account lockout functionality
  - Add database migration for `failed_login_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0`
  - Add database migration for `locked_until TIMESTAMPTZ`
  - Add database migration for `last_failed_login_at TIMESTAMPTZ`
  - Implement lockout logic (5 attempts = 30 minute lockout)
  - Add unlock mechanism for admins

### ⏳ Security Phase 3: Rate Limiting
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium - DoS protection

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement login endpoint rate limiting
  - Add in-memory or Redis-based rate limiter
  - Configure limits (e.g., 10 attempts per IP per 15 minutes)
  - Add rate limit headers to responses
- [ ] Implement registration endpoint rate limiting
  - Prevent signup abuse
  - Configure appropriate limits

### ⏳ Security Phase 4: Production Security Headers
**Priority**: 🟢 Low - Production deployment feature

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add HTTPS enforcement (HSTS) for production
- [ ] Implement environment-based security header configuration
- [ ] Add Content Security Policy refinements
- [ ] Add security header testing

## Future Enhancements (Optional) 🔍 AVAILABLE IF DESIRED

### ⏳ Step 6.1: Interactive Learning Elements
**Priority**: 🟢 Low - Optional enhancements

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add "Try This" exercises to each guide
- [ ] Create hands-on challenges with solutions
- [ ] Add "What happens if..." exploration sections
- [ ] Create guided refactoring exercises

### ⏳ Step 6.2: Real-World Scenarios and Case Studies
**Priority**: 🟢 Low - Optional enhancements

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add realistic business scenarios to guides
- [ ] Create "scaling up" sections (what changes at 10x, 100x, 1000x scale)
- [ ] Document common production issues and solutions
- [ ] Add performance optimization case studies

### ⏳ Step 6.3: Documentation Quality Assurance
**Priority**: 🟢 Low - Optional validation

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test all code examples in documentation
- [ ] Validate all links and references
- [ ] Check consistency across all files
- [ ] Create documentation maintenance guide
