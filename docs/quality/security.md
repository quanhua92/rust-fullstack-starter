## Implemented Security Features âœ…

### Authentication Security

#### Session Fixation Prevention
- **Auto-invalidation**: Sessions older than 30 days are automatically invalidated on login
- **Transaction Safety**: Session cleanup is performed within login transaction for consistency
- **Selective Cleanup**: Only affects very old sessions, preserves recent active sessions
- **Implementation**: `starter/src/auth/services.rs:198-208`

#### Timing Attack Protection
- **Constant-Time Comparison**: Password verification uses constant-time comparison to prevent timing analysis
- **Dummy Hash Processing**: Non-existent users trigger dummy hash computation to maintain consistent timing
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Protects both login attempts and password validation during registration
- **Implementation**: `starter/src/users/models.rs:333+` and `starter/src/auth/services.rs:177-188`

#### Enhanced Password Validation
- **Case-Insensitive Common Password Detection**: Prevents use of common passwords regardless of case variations
- **RFC-Compliant Email Validation**: 75+ validation rules covering edge cases and malformed inputs
- **Comprehensive Security Testing**: 9 security vulnerability tests covering edge cases
- **Unicode and Special Character Handling**: Proper validation of international characters and security bypass attempts
- **Implementation**: `starter/src/users/models.rs:218-333`

#### Database Security
- **Error Propagation**: Replaced unsafe `unwrap_or(0)` patterns with proper error handling
- **Transaction Race Condition Fixes**: Fixed soft-delete operations to prevent concurrent modification issues
- **Consistent RBAC Error Handling**: Standardized authorization error responses across all endpoints
- **Implementation**: `starter/src/users/services.rs:498+`

### Testing Coverage
- **149 Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite including security vulnerability tests
- **Timing Attack Tests**: Specific tests to verify constant-time behavior
- **Session Fixation Tests**: Validates session cleanup behavior during login
- **RBAC Security Tests**: Complete role-based access control validation
- **Database Consistency Tests**: Transaction handling and error propagation validation

## Known Security Issues

### RUSTSEC-2023-0071: RSA Vulnerability in SQLx MySQL Dependency

**Status**: Acknowledged - Not affecting runtime security  
**Issue**: [SQLx GitHub Issue #2911](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/2911)  
**Advisory**: [RUSTSEC-2023-0071](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0071)

#### Description
A Marvin Attack vulnerability exists in the `rsa` crate (version 0.9.8) that allows potential key recovery through timing side-channels. This vulnerability is present as a transitive dependency through `sqlx-mysql`.

#### Why This Doesn't Affect Our Application
1. **PostgreSQL Only**: This application exclusively uses PostgreSQL; no MySQL functionality is utilized at runtime
2. **Compile-Time Dependency**: The `sqlx-mysql` dependency is only included during compilation due to SQLx's macro system requirements
3. **No MySQL Code Paths**: No code paths in the application execute MySQL-related functionality where the RSA vulnerability could be exploited

#### Root Cause
SQLx's macro system requires all database driver dependencies to be available during compilation, even when only using a single database backend. This is a known limitation of the current SQLx architecture.

#### Mitigation
- Dependency is ignored in cargo audit configuration (`.cargo/audit.toml`)
- Issue is tracked upstream in SQLx repository
- Application security is not compromised as MySQL code is never executed
- Monitoring for SQLx updates that resolve this architectural issue

#### Verification
You can verify this doesn't affect runtime by checking:
1. Only PostgreSQL features are enabled in `Cargo.toml`
2. No MySQL connection strings or configurations exist
3. Application only connects to PostgreSQL databases

#### Future Resolution
This will be resolved when:
- SQLx fixes the macro system to only require actual used database drivers
- SQLx updates to a version of the `rsa` crate without this vulnerability
- Alternative database libraries are adopted that don't have this limitation
