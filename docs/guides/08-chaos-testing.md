# Chaos Testing Guide

*This guide introduces chaos engineering principles and explains how to use the comprehensive chaos testing framework to validate system resilience.*

## Overview

Chaos engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system to build confidence in its capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production. This starter includes a complete chaos testing framework that demonstrates how to systematically test failure scenarios while maintaining system reliability.

**Important**: This framework is designed for learning and development environments. For production chaos engineering, adapt these patterns with appropriate safeguards and monitoring.

## Why Chaos Testing?

### The Problem with Traditional Testing

Traditional testing validates that your system works correctly under normal conditions, but real-world systems face:
- **Service failures**: Processes crash, containers die, nodes go offline
- **Network issues**: Timeouts, packet loss, partitions  
- **Resource exhaustion**: Memory leaks, CPU spikes, disk full
- **Dependency failures**: Database outages, external API downtime

### The Chaos Engineering Solution

Chaos engineering proactively introduces controlled failures to:
- **Discover weaknesses** before they cause outages
- **Validate recovery mechanisms** work as designed
- **Build confidence** in system resilience
- **Improve monitoring** and alerting systems

## Chaos Engineering Principles

### 1. Build a Hypothesis Around Steady State

Before introducing chaos, define what "normal" looks like:

```
Hypothesis: The system should maintain 99% API success rate 
even when the database is temporarily unavailable for 30 seconds.
```

### 2. Vary Real-World Events

Simulate failures that actually happen in production:
- Process crashes (kill -9)
- Resource exhaustion (high CPU/memory)
- Network issues (timeouts, partitions)
- Dependency failures (database down)

### 3. Run Experiments in Production

*Note: This starter focuses on development/staging environments, but the patterns scale to production with proper safeguards.*

### 4. Automate Experiments Continuously

Chaos testing should be part of your regular development workflow, not a one-time activity.

### 5. Minimize Blast Radius

Start small and gradually increase scope:
- Single service → Multiple services
- Short duration → Longer duration  
- Low traffic → High traffic

## Framework Architecture

### Docker-Based Architecture

The chaos testing framework uses Docker containers for realistic testing environments:

- **Container Isolation**: Each service runs in isolated Docker containers
- **Resource Constraints**: CPU and memory limits simulate real constraints
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Easy scaling of worker containers for load testing
- **Realistic Failures**: Container crashes and restarts mirror real deployment issues

### Core Components

The chaos testing framework consists of three main parts:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   test-chaos.sh │    │   Helper Scripts│    │   API Testing   │

│ • Tracks results│    │ Executes chaos  │    │                 │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### 1. Orchestration Layer (`test-chaos.sh`)

The main orchestrator that:
- **Manages scenarios**: Coordinates different failure types
- **Controls difficulty**: Scales load and duration
- **Tracks results**: Measures success rates and recovery times
- **Generates reports**: Creates detailed analysis of test runs

### 2. Chaos Helpers (`scripts/helpers/`)

Modular utilities for specific chaos operations:

**`auth-helper.sh`**: Creates test users and tokens
```bash
# Creates authenticated user for load testing
./scripts/helpers/auth-helper.sh --prefix "chaos_test"
# Returns: {"token": "abc123...", "user_id": "uuid-here"}
```

**`task-flood.sh`**: Generates high task loads
```bash
# Create 100 tasks with 0.1s delay
./scripts/helpers/task-flood.sh --count 100 --delay 0.1 --auth "$TOKEN"
```

**`service-chaos.sh`**: Simulates service failures
```bash
# Kill and restart server after 30s
./scripts/helpers/service-chaos.sh restart --service server --delay 30
```

### 3. Validation Layer (`test-with-curl.sh`)

Comprehensive API testing that:
- **Tests all endpoints**: Health, auth, tasks, DLQ
- **Validates responses**: Status codes, JSON structure
- **Measures success rates**: Calculates percentage of passing tests
- **Reports consistently**: Standard output format

- **System stability**: No crashes or data loss during scaling events

**Difficulty scaling**:
- **Level 1**: 75 total tasks, 2s delays, 5min deadline (conservative)
- **Level 3**: 120 total tasks, 3s delays, 4min deadline (standard)
- **Level 6**: 225 total tasks, 4s delays, 3min deadline (extreme stress)

**Success criteria**:
- **Primary**: 100% task completion within deadline
- **Secondary**: 100% completion but deadline exceeded (partial pass)
- **Failure**: <100% completion or system errors

**Key insights**: This scenario demonstrates real-world scaling patterns where systems must maintain service quality during infrastructure changes.

## Running Chaos Tests

### Quick Start

The chaos testing framework uses Docker containers for realistic testing environments:

```bash
# Basic chaos testing (recommended for daily use)
# Automatically builds and runs containers with latest code
./scripts/test-chaos.sh

# Advanced testing with higher difficulty
./scripts/test-chaos.sh --difficulty 3

# Test specific scenarios only
./scripts/test-chaos.sh --scenarios "db-failure,task-flood"

# Verbose output with detailed logs
./scripts/test-chaos.sh --difficulty 5 --verbose

# Container scaling and multi-worker testing
./scripts/test-chaos.sh --scenarios "multi-worker-chaos"

# Dynamic worker scaling testing
./scripts/test-chaos.sh --scenarios "dynamic-scaling"
```

**Docker Container Benefits:**
- **Container Isolation**: Each service runs in isolated Docker containers for realistic testing
- **Resource Constraints**: CPU and memory limits simulate real deployment constraints
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Easy scaling of worker containers with Docker Compose
- **Realistic Failures**: Container crashes and restarts mirror actual deployment issues
- **Fresh Code**: Automatically rebuilds images ensuring tests use latest changes

### Progressive Testing Strategy

**Phase 1: Development Validation**
```bash
# Daily developer testing (2 minutes)
./scripts/test-chaos.sh --difficulty 1 --scenarios "baseline,db-failure"
```

**Phase 2: Integration Testing**
```bash
# Pre-commit testing (5 minutes)
./scripts/test-chaos.sh --difficulty 2 --scenarios "baseline,server-restart,worker-restart"
```

**Phase 3: Load Testing**
```bash
# Performance validation (8 minutes)
./scripts/test-chaos.sh --difficulty 3 --scenarios "task-flood,circuit-breaker"
```

**Phase 4: Resilience Testing**
```bash
# Pre-production validation (15 minutes)
./scripts/test-chaos.sh --difficulty 4 --scenarios "mixed-chaos,recovery,multi-worker-chaos,dynamic-scaling"
```

**Phase 5: Production Readiness**
```bash
# Full chaos testing (20 minutes)
./scripts/test-chaos.sh --difficulty 5 --verbose
```

### Environment Setup

Before running chaos tests, ensure your environment is ready:

```bash
# 1. Start the full development environment
./scripts/dev-server.sh 3000

# 2. Verify all services are healthy
./scripts/test-with-curl.sh

# 3. Run chaos tests
./scripts/test-chaos.sh --difficulty 1
```

## Interpreting Results

### Success Metrics

The framework tracks several key metrics:

**API Success Rate**: Percentage of API calls that succeed
- Level 1-2: Should be 95-100%
- Level 3-4: Should be 85-95%
- Level 5: Should be 80%+

**Recovery Time**: Time from container failure to first successful API call
- Target: < 20 seconds for Docker-based scenarios
- Warning: > 30 seconds indicates container issues

**Task Processing**: Tasks completed vs. tasks created
- Should maintain processing throughput
- Failed tasks should be moved to DLQ

**Circuit Breaker**: Proper activation and recovery
- Should trigger on repeated failures
- Should recover when service is restored

### Warning Signs

🚨 **Critical Issues**:
- Recovery time > 30 seconds
- Success rate < 70%
- Memory leaks during testing
- Tasks stuck in processing state
- Circuit breaker not recovering

⚠️ **Areas for Improvement**:
- Success rate 70-85%
- Container recovery time 20-30 seconds
- High task failure rates
- Slow container health checks

## Customization and Extension

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Custom configuration
export PORT=8080
export BASE_URL="https://staging.example.com"
export OUTPUT_DIR="chaos-results"
export VERBOSE=true

./scripts/test-chaos.sh
```

### Adding Custom Scenarios

Add new scenarios by modifying `test-chaos.sh`:

```bash
# Add to the case statement in run_scenario()
my-custom-test)
    log "INFO" "Running my custom test"
    
    # Your custom chaos logic here
    # Use helper scripts for common operations
    ./scripts/helpers/service-chaos.sh restart --service server
    ./scripts/helpers/task-flood.sh --count 50 --auth "$TOKEN"
    
    if run_api_test "Custom Test"; then
        log "SUCCESS" "Custom scenario passed"
        PASSED_SCENARIOS=$((PASSED_SCENARIOS + 1))
        TEST_RESULTS+=("✅ my-custom-test: PASS")
    else
        log "ERROR" "Custom scenario failed"
        TEST_RESULTS+=("❌ my-custom-test: FAIL")
    fi
    ;;
```

### Testing Specific Task Types

Customize task flood testing for specific scenarios:

```bash
# Test webhook resilience
./scripts/helpers/task-flood.sh --type webhook --count 100 --auth "$TOKEN"

# Test circuit breaker with specific task type
./scripts/helpers/task-flood.sh --type nonexistent_type --count 20 --auth "$TOKEN"
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Chaos Testing

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-validation.sh

echo "🧪 Running pre-deployment chaos testing..."

# Start services
./scripts/dev-server.sh 3000

# Run progressive testing
for level in 1 2 3; do
    echo "Testing difficulty level $level..."
    if ! ./scripts/test-chaos.sh --difficulty $level; then
        echo "❌ Chaos testing failed at level $level"
        exit 1
    fi
done

echo "✅ All chaos tests passed - ready for deployment"
```

# Check individual components
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/health
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/tasks/stats

# Manual service testing
./scripts/test-server.sh 3000
./scripts/status.sh
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand chaos engineering principles and the testing framework:

1. **Start Simple**: Run `./scripts/test-chaos.sh --difficulty 1` to get familiar
2. **Explore Scenarios**: Try different scenarios to understand failure modes
3. **Analyze Results**: Review generated reports to identify improvement areas
4. **Integrate with Development**: Add chaos testing to your development workflow
5. **Scale Up**: Gradually increase difficulty as your system improves
